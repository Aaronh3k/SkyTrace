# SkyTrace - Real-time Flight Tracking App üõ´ üåç

SkyTrace is a feature-rich Android application designed for aviation enthusiasts and frequent flyers. The app provides real-time flight tracking information, allowing users to view all current flights on a map along with their location, speed, altitude, and status updates. 

## Functionality üöÄ

| Feature | Description | Tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Splash Screen | The app welcomes users with a visually appealing splash screen. | - |
| Authentication | Secure login/Sign Up process is implemented via email/password and Google authentication. | Firebase Auth (Email + Google) |
| Data Persistence | User data such as account information and tracked flights are persistently stored and can be viewed or removed as needed. | Firebase (Database + Cloud Storage) |
| CRUD Operations | Users can perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on their account entries. They can also add and remove tracked flights, which are displayed as a list. | - |
| Real-Time Mapping | The location of flights is displayed on Google Maps, allowing users to view real-time information about nearby and global flights. | Google Maps |
| Third-Party API | The app integrates with the OpenSky Network API to provide accurate and up-to-date flight information. | OpenSky Network |


## UX Approach

The User Experience approach adopted for the development of SkyTrace prioritized user-friendliness and simplicity. With a keen focus on Material Design guidelines, the design process ensured a blend of visual appeal with practical functionality. The intent was to create an application that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also retains a high degree of usability.

Understanding the needs of both aviation enthusiasts and casual users was key in shaping the design. Clear labeling, intuitive navigation, and recognizable icons were incorporated to offer a seamless experience, enabling users to navigate the app with ease and minimal confusion.

The implementation of real-time flight tracking on a map interface further enhances user interaction, offering a visual and interactive way of understanding flight patterns and information. The integration of third-party APIs like OpenSky Network ensures the accuracy and timeliness of flight data, which is crucial for a trustworthy user experience.

Finally, the app‚Äôs functionality was designed to be clear and concise. From secure authentication to persistent data storage, every feature was developed with user convenience and utility in mind. This comprehensive approach to the User Experience aims to make SkyTrace an efficient and enjoyable tool for all users, regardless of their aviation knowledge or app usage expertise.

## DX Approach

The SkyTrace app was developed using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern. This approach is a popular architectural pattern in software development that effectively separates the business logic of an application from its presentation logic.

The MVVM pattern simplifies the app's structure by dividing it into three distinct parts: Model, View, and ViewModel. This separation facilitates easier testing and maintenance of the app, as each component can be developed and tested independently.

**Model:** This represents the business logic of the application, which includes the data related to flights and how it is stored.

**View:** This represents the presentation of data to the user, including the User Interface (UI) and any user interaction. The view is responsible for displaying the data received from the ViewModel.

**ViewModel:** The ViewModel serves as an intermediary between the View and the Model. It handles user inputs, processes the data from the Model, and updates the View accordingly.

Adopting the MVVM pattern also made it easier to manage the app's data flow, ensuring that the UI remains consistent with the underlying data. This robust approach to the Developer Experience (DX) aims to make SkyTrace a well-structured and maintainable app.


## Git Approach

The development of the SkyTrace app was organized using a structured Git approach. This approach promoted a well-documented and efficient development process. It allowed for change tracking over time, maintenance of a clean and stable codebase, and facilitated continuous improvement and bug fixes.

The following Git approach was used during the development process:

1. **Branches:** Two main branches were used - the main branch (master) for stable releases and a development branch (dev) for ongoing development work.

2. **Feature Development:** The dev branch was checked out to start working on the assigned issue. All changes and updates were committed to this branch.

3. **Pull Requests (PRs):** Once a feature or bug fix was implemented and tested, a PR was created to merge the changes from the dev branch into the master branch.

4. **Code Review:** The PR was then reviewed. Any necessary changes were made based on feedback before the final merging.

5. **Merging and Issue Resolution:** After a thorough review, the PR was merged into the master branch, and the linked issue was marked as resolved.

6. **Releases:** After a set of features were implemented and merged into the master branch, a tagged release of the application was created.

7. **Bug Fixes:** If any bugs were identified after a release, they were treated as new issues, and the above process was followed to resolve them. After bugs were fixed and tested, a new tagged release of the application was created.

This structured Git approach played a pivotal role in maintaining an organized, efficient, and successful development process for the SkyTrace app.

## Personal Statement

The journey of developing SkyTrace, a real-time flight tracking app, was both exhilarating and challenging. As an individual working on this project, it allowed me to dive deep into the realm of Android app development and explore various tools and technologies.

With no prior experience in mobile app development, I had to learn and apply new skills rapidly. Working with Google Maps API, Firebase for authentication and storage, implementing MVVM design pattern, and integrating with the OpenSky Network API were all part of this steep learning curve. 

Git was my companion throughout this journey for version control, and it proved to be an indispensable tool for managing the codebase effectively. I encountered multiple issues during development, but the support of various online communities like Stack Overflow and Chat GPT helped me navigate through those challenges.

There were a few features, like a more detailed flight history and advanced user settings, which I couldn't fully implement due to time constraints and balancing work with other modules. However, these are areas that I have identified for future enhancement.

In conclusion, the experience of developing SkyTrace was an enriching one. It has allowed me to grow as a developer, gain hands-on experience in mobile app development, and understand the nuances of creating a user-centric application. I'm excited about the potential improvements and refinements that I could bring to this project in the future.
